# SHC Library Sign-in Portal
This is a sign-in portal developed for the Sacred Heart College library, as my NCEA scholarship project for 2025, with the following features.

## Features
- Sign-in option
- Sign-out option
- A photo of the Sacred Heart College school of imagination
- Works with a library scanner to scan Student ID's!
- Runs on an iPad/Android Tablet perfectly!

## To-Dos
- The backend! I also want to make an admin portal too and make a version which any school can use for sign-in's/sign-out's!

## Future roadmap
- Custom dashboard for schools to update their own version!
- Possibly putting it on the App Store if there's enough demand!

## Instructions to run locally!

- **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SHC-Library-Signin.git
   cd SHC-Library-Signin
   ```

- **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

- **Start the development server:**
   ```sh

   This will launch the Expo development server. You can then open the app on your device, emulator, or browser.
